Wireframe Article Reaction:

The wireframing article that we were assigned to read was informational and had some pretty good advice. It basically said that there were five basic steps/tips to wireframing anything. First, you have to identify and understand your problem. I think this is a step that most people underestimate and subsequently donâ€™t complete. I especially liked how the article specified what kind of questions you should be asking/considering when trying to understand your problem. The next step is sketching. I think sketching is one of the most important steps because it also where you can realize if there are any errors or assumptions that were made. The next piece of advice was to get feedback throughout the process, another important aspect of wireframing. I know that I find it hard to listen to feedback without taking it personally, but I know that it is also an invaluable portion of doing anything creative. The last two steps are to know your tools and your audience. The article was thorough in describing what exactly that means. I like how the author brought in her personal experience as a designer to give concrete examples of how this can be helpful. Overall, this article was helpful and contained a lot of important information on wireframing.
